'''
    This file defines the Quiver file class which is used to store PDB files and their associated scores.
    This class is going to be the simplest and quickest implementation of a database for the PDB files and their scores.
    This Quiver implementation will be just a list of PDB lines in a single file, with a tag for each PDB file.

    Later this can be made more sophisticated by using a proper database, but for now this will be the simplest implementation.
